			<p>Native to the plains of VR Chat and popularised through their recent population boom in January that spread into YouTube, these small, but persistent creatures are known for their incessant search for de wae.  Living in colonies of thousands at a time, their monarchical structure is dependent upon knowledge of the location of their queen.  When they feel threatened or suspect an imposter has replaced their queen, they signal an attack through ferocious clicking, followed by an onslaught of spitting.</p>
